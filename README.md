	**initial requirements**
The task was to develop a single-page app that provides the ability to search Outdoorsy listings by keyword.
Users has to be able to type keywords in a text field. Typing in the text field should cause search results to appear automatically.
The search results should display an image of the vehicle and the vehicleâ€™s name. The keyboard should hide when the user starts to scroll.

	* the API details: https://github.com/outdoorsy/interview-challenge-android/blob/main/API.md
 All these requirements are met, the code is able to build and you're very welcome to do it and check the app on your device.

	**technical solutions**
 - **Kotlin** as the only coding language.
 - **Coroutines & Flows** for all async work.
 - **Jetpack Compose** as implementation of all UI.
 - **Moder Android Architecture** approach as a sceleton for nanming/placing packages & classes.
 - **Retrofit 2** as a REST network client.
 - **Coil** for downloading images.

	**what's next (very soon)**
	- fix colors in SearchBar - probably by replacing it with other composables.
 	- adding error state for UI - for beautiful handling of any network cases.
   	- fake-data preparation tract with its own DataSource for consuming mock JSON.
   	- optimization of NetworkEntity processing (now there are three loops).
   	- adding option to remember search queries (at least for a session).
   	- would be nice to add pagination for network response.
	- **Hilt** as dependency injection mechanism.
 	- **unit tests** for ViewModel and other logic-related code.
	- **UI tests** just to have them :)
